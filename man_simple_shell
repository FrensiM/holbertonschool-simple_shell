.B simple_shell
[command] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Simple_shell
Is a project written using the C-programming language with the object of creating a basic version of a Unix shell able to intepret and execute commands provided by the use. The simple_shell reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
.SH INVOCATION
It has the advantage to be executed interactivly and non-interactivly. That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.B Interactive mode:

vargrant$ ./hsh

$ /bin/ls

.B Non-interactive mode:

vagrant$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh

AUTHORS README.md command_path.c shell.c shell.h

$
.SH COMMANDS
The simple_shell accepts commands located in /usr/bin directory. When a user types an invalid command, an error message is printed.

vagrant$ ./hsh

$ hi

hi: Not found

$

Some of this commands are:

ls - list directories and files

echo - display the text passed in as an argument

pwd - print working directory

It also accepts the builtin commands (exit and env).
